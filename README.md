# WabbaRust

Just a fun side project, attempt to make a tool akin to the amazing [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

## Todo

### CLI

- Truncate the filename of the download so that the download bar & percentage all fit on one line.
- Add a `config` subcommand to configure Wabbarust, so the user can set the API key
